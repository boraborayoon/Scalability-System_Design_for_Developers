# 1. Client
- The client holds our user interface. The user interface is the presentation part of the application
- The user interface runs on the client. A client is a gateway to our application.

## 1-1. Types of Clients
### 1-1-1. Thin Client
- A thin client holds just the user interface of the application which contains no business logic. For every action, the client sends a request to the backend server, just like in a three-tier application.
### 1-1-2. Thick Client
- Thick client holds all or some part of the business logic. These are the **two-tier** applications.
- The typical examples of fat clients are utility apps, online games, and so on.

# 2. Server (application server)
- The primary task of a web server is to receive the requests from the client and provide the response after executing the business logic based on the request parameters received from the client.

## 2-1. Server-side Rendering
-  A server is used to render the user interface on the backend and then send the generated data to the client. 

# 3. Request-Response Model
- The client and the server have a request-response model. The client sends the request and the server responds with the data.
- **No request means no response!!**
